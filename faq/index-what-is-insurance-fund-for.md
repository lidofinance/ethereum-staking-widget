title: What is the Lido Insurance Fund used for?
---

Lido [Insurance fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8B3f33234ABD88493c0Cd28De33D583B70beDe35) can cover most of the slashing risks. Read more about risk scenarios [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/redirecting-incoming-revenue-stream-from-insurance-fund-to-dao-treasury/2528/20?u=kadmil).

In case of a widespread slashing incident (which is still possible, but unlikely to happen given the quality of the Lido validator set and its proven track record) the decision to recover losses from this Insurance fund will be made based on the vote of the Lido DAO.
