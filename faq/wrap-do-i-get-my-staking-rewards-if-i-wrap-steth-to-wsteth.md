title: Do I get my staking rewards if I wrap stETH to wstETH?
---

Yes, wrapped stETH earns staking rewards at the same rate as regular stETH. When you keep your stETH in a wrapper you cannot see your daily staking rewards. However, when you unwrap your wstETH your new stETH balance will have increased relative to pre-wrapped amount to reflect your earned rewards.
