title: Lido Referral Program
---

The Lido Referral Program transitioned to whitelist mode (in line with the following [proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/switch-referral-program-to-whitelist-mode/1014)) which means that only [whitelisted referrals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JO906tAVoPW9m0F1I39bxB2UIu7E41NSbxIFIzT18I/edit#gid=1322321646) are able to participate and receive rewards. The goal of this is to help improve the security and productivity of the Lido referral program.

Wallets, platforms, and protocols are welcome to apply for whitelisting on Lido [governance forum](https://research.lido.fi/t/referral-program-whitelisting/1039)
