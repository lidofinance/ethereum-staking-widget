title: Is it safe to work with Lido?
---

Lido is a liquid staking solution and fits the next points:

- Open-sourcing & continuous review of all code.
- Committee of elected, best-in-class validators to minimise staking risk.
- Use of non-custodial staking service to eliminate counterparty risk.
- Use of DAO for governance decisions &amp; to manage risk factors.

Usually when staking ETH you choose only one validator. In the case of Lido you stake across many validators, minimising your staking risk.
