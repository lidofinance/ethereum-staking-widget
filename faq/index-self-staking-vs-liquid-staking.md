title: What is the difference between self staking and liquid staking?
---

Ethereum is soon to be the biggest staking economy in the space. However, staking on Beacon chain requires expert knowledge and complex and costly infrastructure. There are several reasons why - the main being the fact that slashing and offline penalties can get very severe if the staking is managed improperly. In addition to this, self-staking brings with it a minimum deposit of 32 ETH and a token lock-up which could last years.

Through the use of a liquid self-staking service such as Lido, users can eliminate these inconveniences and benefit from secure, non-custodial staking backed by industry leaders.
