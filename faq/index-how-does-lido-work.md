title: How does Lido work?
---

When staking with Lido, users receive stETH tokens on a 1:1 basis representing their staked ETH. stETH balances can be used like regular ETH to earn yields and lending rewards, and are updated on a daily basis to reflect your ETH staking rewards. Note that there are no lock-ups or minimum deposits when staking with Lido.

When using Lido, users receive secure staking rewards in real-time, allowing for participation in the securing of Ethereum without the associated risks and downside potential.
