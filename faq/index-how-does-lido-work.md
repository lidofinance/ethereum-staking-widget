title: How does Lido work?
---

When staking with Lido, users receive stETH tokens which are issued 1:1 to their initial stake. stETH balances can be used like regular ETH to earn yields and lending rewards, and are updated on a daily basis to reflect your ETH staking rewards. Note that there are no lock-ups or minimum deposits when staking with Lido.

When using Lido, users receive staking rewards in real-time, and they also could use staked tokens across the DeFi ecosystem to compound rewards.
