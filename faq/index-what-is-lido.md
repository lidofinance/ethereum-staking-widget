title: What is Lido?
---

Lido is a liquid staking solution for Beacon chain backed by industry-leading staking providers. Lido lets users stake their ETH - without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure - whilst participating in on-chain activities, e.g. lending.

Our goal is to solve the problems associated with initial Beacon chain staking - illiquidity, immovability and accessibility - making staked ETH liquid and allowing for participation with any amount of ETH to improve security of the Ethereum network.

As part of our continuing efforts to be a force for decentralization, we have published a [scorecard](https://lido.fi/scorecard) for community input and accountability.
