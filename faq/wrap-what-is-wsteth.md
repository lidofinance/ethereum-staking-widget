title: What is wstETH?
---

wstETH is a wrapped version of stETH. Due to the nature of Lido, the amount of stETH on your balance is not constant - it changes daily as staking rewards come in. As some DeFi protocols require a constant balance mechanism for tokens, wstETH keeps your balance of stETH fixed and uses an underlying share system to reflect your earned staking rewards.

Example:

- You wrap 100 stETH to 99.87 wstETH.
- You continue to earn rewards on your wstETH.
- When you unwrap your wstETH, you receive 101 stETH.
