You can wrap your stETH tokens using [stake.lido.fi/wrap](/wrap--QUERY-PARAMS--). Simply connect your wallet, unlock your stETH tokens and press Wrap.

You can also choose to convert your ETH to wstETH directly. To do this, select ETH on the token drop down. This allows you to save on gas when compared to swapping from ETH to stETH to wstETH.
