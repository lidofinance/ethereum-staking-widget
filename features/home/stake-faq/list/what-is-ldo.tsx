        LDO is an Ethereum token granting governance rights in the Lido DAO. The
        Lido DAO governs a set of liquid staking protocols, decides on key
        parameters (e.g., fees) and executes protocol upgrades to ensure
        efficiency and stability. By holding the LDO token, one is granted
        voting rights within the Lido DAO. The more LDO locked in a userâ€™s
        voting contract, the greater the decision-making power the voter gets.
