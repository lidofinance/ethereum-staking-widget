        Yes, wrapped stETH gets staking rewards at the same rate as regular
        stETH. When you keep your stETH in a wrapper you cannot see your daily
        staking rewards. However, when you unwrap your wstETH your new stETH
        balance will have increased relative to pre-wrapped amount to reflect
        your received rewards.
