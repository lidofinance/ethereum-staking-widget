        Bunker mode is triggered under three conditions when the penalties might
        be big enough to have a significant impact on the protocolâ€™s rewards:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Mass slashing.</li>
        <li>
          Penalties exceeding rewards in the current period between two Oracle
          reports.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lower than expected Lido validators&apos; performance in the current
          period between two Oracle reports and penalties exceeding rewards at
          the end of&nbsp;it.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </Accordion>
