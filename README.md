# Lido Ethereum Liquid Staking Widget

A widget for submitting Ether to the pool based on [Lido Frontend Template](https://github.com/lidofinance/lido-frontend-template).

### Pre-requisites

- Node.js v16+
- Yarn package manager

This project requires an .env file which is distributed via private communication channels. A sample can be found in .env.

### Development

Step 1. Copy the contents of `sample.env` to `.env.local`

```bash
cp sample.env .env.local
```

Step 2. Fill out the `.env.local`. You may need to sign up for [Infura](https://infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), if you haven't already, to be able to use Ethereum JSON RPC connection.

Step 3. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

Step 4. Start the development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Environment variables

Note! Avoid using `NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables as it hinders our CI pipeline. Please use server-side environment variables and pass them to the client using `getInitialProps` in `_app.js`.

### Automatic versioning
