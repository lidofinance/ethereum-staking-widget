## Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project! Your enthusiasm and support are appreciated. Comprehensive contributing guidelines are actively being developed to ensure a smooth and collaborative contribution process.

**Note:** At this moment, there is no guarantee that pull requests or issues will be processed, as the workflow and guidelines are still being established to make participation easier for everyone in the project. The importance of community involvement is understood, and an inclusive and comfortable environment for all contributors is being created.

Rest assured, as soon as the contributing guide is ready, contributions and any encountered issues will be welcomed and addressed. An announcement will be made when the guidelines are finalized and open for contributions.

In the meantime, exploring the project, familiarizing yourself with the codebase, and providing valuable feedback or suggestions during this development phase are encouraged.

Thank you for your patience and understanding. Future contributions are eagerly anticipated once the contributing guidelines are in place!
