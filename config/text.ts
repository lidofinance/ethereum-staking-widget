export const LIDO_APR_TOOLTIP_TEXT =
  "APR is denominated in terms of ETH, not USD, and is not a guaranteed or promised return or profit. The current Ethereum's APR is ${apr.eth}. Lido's APR is currently lower due to the activation queue for ETH validators as well as Lido's staking rewards fee. Lido's APR could grow as the rate of active stakers on Lido becomes higher, but will not exceed Ethereum's APR. With Lido, you receive staking rewards within 24 hours of your deposit being made, without waiting for validator activation.";
